**GammonX** is a decentralized implementation of the classic backgammon game, built on the Aptos testnet. It leverages Rust for the backend and Moov smart contracts for handling game logic on-chain. The aim is to provide a fair, secure, and transparent gaming experience by utilizing blockchain technology. Unlike traditional online games, GammonX removes the need for intermediaries and ensures trustless gameplay through decentralized architecture.

## Problem it Solves

In traditional online games, the central server and game operator have full control, which can lead to issues such as biased game results, manipulation, or cheating. Players often have to trust centralized platforms for fairness, security, and transparency. **GammonX** solves this problem by decentralizing the entire game on the Aptos blockchain. Every move and game state is recorded on-chain, making tampering or cheating impossible. This trustless model ensures that all players are given a fair gaming environment, backed by blockchain’s transparency and security.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Gameplay**: No need for a central authority; the game runs entirely on smart contracts.
- **Blockchain Integration**: All moves and game states are recorded on the Aptos blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Trustless System**: Players can trust the game outcomes as they are validated by smart contracts and recorded on-chain.
- **Rust Backend**: The backend is developed in Rust for high performance and efficient state management.
- **Moov Smart Contracts**: Game logic is handled using Moov smart contracts on the Aptos testnet.

## How it Works

1. **Game Initialization**: Players create or join a backgammon match, with the game state stored and managed via smart contracts.
2. **On-chain Game Logic**: Game moves, dice rolls, and state transitions are handled by Moov smart contracts, ensuring that all game interactions are fair and transparent.
3. **Trustless Gameplay**: Each player’s move is recorded on-chain, ensuring there is no way to manipulate or alter the game results.
4. **Real-time Feedback**: The backend provides real-time game state updates through the Rust-based server, ensuring smooth and efficient gameplay.

## Use Cases

- **Competitive Gameplay**: Play against others in a trustless environment, knowing that all moves and outcomes are securely stored on the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Gaming**: Experience a real-world application of blockchain technology in traditional board games, introducing transparency and fairness into gaming.
- **Smart Contract Demonstration**: GammonX is a practical use case for showing how Moov smart contracts can manage complex game logic on the Aptos network.

## Conclusion

**GammonX** is more than just a backgammon game. It’s a decentralized gaming solution that leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency, fairness, and security in every match. By decentralizing gameplay on the Aptos testnet, GammonX opens the door to a new era of online board games where trust is not required because it is built-in.
